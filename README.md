# test1 WIP
Part of the project that I was involved in, this file is an example of what would happen, the player would interact with a robot and 
control the game only by presenting coloured blocks to the robot, if the player did well, the C# would instruct the robot to activate 
motors to relase a prize to the player. It comprises of:

A mini GUI that combines 2 games (which I do not take credit for though I have made small edits to both) with the feature to switch between
either English or French as the language control, 

Plan on adding other features such as high scores which will save after every instance, the ability to switch the voice from English to French,
making the games completly controlled by colour blocks and require the player to be a certain distance away to play.

Original code became corrupt so need to add the code in piece by piece.
